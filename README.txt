1. User Storage: For holding all of my users I used a TreeMap by storing the user's userName as the key.
				 This provides me with very fast user look up, and I can modify the user freely by having its userName.
				 Futhermore, this allows me to add unlimited amounts of users to my program.
				 
2. Trail Storage:  For holding all of my trails I used a HashSet. This is due to having a capped amount of trails being allowed in the program
				   and also provides me with fast searching which I can do by using streams.
		
3. Hiking history: For my Hiking History I used a LinkedList so I can access each of my hikes in the order that they were hiked

4. Hiking Photos: For my Hiking photos I used a LinkedList so I can access them by the order in which the user uploaded them.
